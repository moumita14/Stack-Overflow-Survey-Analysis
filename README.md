# Stack-Overflow-Survey-Analysis

# Overview

For this project, I explored the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, to gain some insights regarding the satisfaction  level and salary trends among software developers. 

My analysis revolved around the following questions:

1. Which country has the highest job satisfaction for developers?

2. Is there any variation in satisfaction rate between developers with an undergraduate degree in IT field vs non-IT field?

3. Does the organization size impact the satisfaction level of employees?

4. Do developers who contribute to open source projects have higher salaries?
